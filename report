I created a collection of ragas in Firebase Cloud Firestore manually and displayed it on the webpage.

I also created a 'ragas_details.html' page and designed it to work dynamically for each raga.

and designed the 'ragas_details.html' page with sections for Arohanam and Avrohanam.

uploaded the Arohanam and Avrohanam details to Cloud Firestore manually and fetched the values to display on the website.

designed the URL based on the clicked raga and displayed the raga's name in the URL.

uploaded the ragas' MP3 files to Firebase Storage, retrieved the URLs, stored them in Firestore, and displayed the ragas on the webpage.

I learned about routing, Apache server configuration, HTTP, SSH, and URL structures.
